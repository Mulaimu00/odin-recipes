    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        To make pancakes, combine dry ingredients such as flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl, mix together wet ingredients like buttermilk, egg, and melted butter, then combine both mixtures until just combined.
    </p>

        Heat a skillet or griddle and cook the batter until golden brown. Serve with your favorite toppings like syrup, fruit, or whipped cream. Enjoy!
